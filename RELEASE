Steps to do a release for version VER:

* In site/:
	* ./update_version.sh VER
	* Make sure images are up to date
	* Update index.html writeup
	* commit / push
* ./gradlew assemble
* copy ./build/libs/philterVER.jar to site/
* in site,/ run ./sync_site (nearlyfreespeech.com's password is the password)
* Tag the repository with the version name
* Update versions .github/workflows/publish.yaml
* push and puss --tags
* Run the workflow (do _NOT_ "rerun" the workflow, that will rerun that older version)
* Update the descriptions /images on modrinth and curseforge
